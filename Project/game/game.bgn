INFO:Bitgen:40 - Replacing "Auto" with "NoWait" for option "Match_cycle".  Most
   commonly, bitgen has determined and will use a specific value instead of the
   generic command-line value of "Auto".  Alternately, this message appears if
   the same option is specified multiple times on the command-line.  In this
   case, the option listed last will be used.
